# Modern CMake Examples

## Overview

This repository is a collection of as simple as possible CMake projects (with a focus on __installing__). The idea is to try and help understand exactly what each part of a `CMakeLists.txt` file does and why it is needed.

This is basically intended as a series of reminders to help me remember how to use CMake 🤦

Please see the [Core Example README](examples/core/README.md) for steps on using the example libraries and the [Installing README](installing/README.md) for an overview of installing CMake libraries. The [More Example](examples/more/) section contains slightly more complex examples and will continue to grow.

## Disclaimer

I am __NOT__ a CMake expert - these examples may contain gaffs, faux pas, mistakes etc etc.. Please take everything with a pinch of salt and if you recognize a blatant error or mistake please feel free to create an issue or PR.

## Background

For the longest time I just didn't grok __installing__ in CMake<sup>1</sup>.

I didn't understand _why_ you'd ever want to do it, or _what_ it was useful for. When I started looking into _how_ to do it I could not make head nor tail of all the various __install__ commands. While trying to figure all this stuff out I was immersing myself in trying to learn Modern CMake (targets, targets targets...) and how these two things are related.

The examples in this repo are the culmination of many months of sporadic research to try and understand CMake more fully and write better CMake scripts.

I'm sharing my journey so far to hopefully help some other poor soul who is in the same boat I'm in. With any luck there will be something someone finds useful here.

For an explanation<sup>2</sup> of _what_ (in the context of CMake) __installing__  is, please see the [installing](installing/README.md) section and take a look at the various [example](examples/core) projects for context.

1. I recently discovered a kindred spirit on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/6m7sp6/cmake_and_c_whats_the_deal_with_installing/)
2. My interpretation?

## Miscellaneous

While using CMake over the last several months I've stumbled across a few useful little bits and bobs that I feel are worth recording/sharing.

### Less `cd`-ing

To run CMake from your source directory (instead of having to `mkdir build && cd build`) you can pass `-S` and the path to your source folder (most likely just `.` for where you currently are) and `-B` to specify the build folder.

```bash
cd <project/root>
cmake -S . -B build/
```

You then just need to remember to call

```bash
cmake --build build/
```

to actually build your project.

> Note: The `-S` option was added to CMake in version `3.13`. Before then you could use the undocumented `-H` option. I'd recommend sticking with `-S` now if you can 🙂.

### compile_commands.json

You should absolutely use `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` when generating your project to have CMake create a `compile_commands.json` file for you. This is useful for all sorts of tools (`clang-tidy`, `cppcheck`, `oclint`, `include-what-you-use` etc etc...)

```bash
# from the build/ folder
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
```

### Defines

Sometimes it's really useful to be able to set defines at the command line when running the CMake generator. An easy way to do this is to add a simple generator expression to your `CMakeLists.txt` file in `target_compile_definitions`.

```bash
target_compile_definitions(
    ${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE
    $<$<BOOL:${YOUR_DEFINE}>:YOUR_DEFINE>)
```

In your code you can then use this define for some sort of conditional compilation.

```c++
#ifdef YOUR_DEFINE
// something useful
#endif // YOUR_DEFINE
```

And when invoking `cmake` you can pass a CMake variable like so if you want that macro to be defined.

```bash
# from the build/ folder
cmake -DYOUR_DEFINE ..
```

If you don't pass the variable then the generator expression will evaluate to false and no define will be added.

### Extra Output

Sometimes when building with CMake to diagnose an issue you might want more info about exactly what's being compiled. You can see everything that's passed to the compiler when building with the `-- VERBOSE` flag.

```bash
# from the build/ folder
cmake --build . -- VERBOSE=1
```

## CMake Resources

I've been attempting to learn CMake for a while and have built up quite a list of articles/blogs/documentation that have helped inform my understanding up to this point. Please see them listed below (mainly for my benefit so I have them all in one place).
